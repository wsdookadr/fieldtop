Intro
-----

Overflow-Checker looks at all fields in all tables and all databases
and analyzes how close the values in each field are to the maximum
(or minimum) allowed value for the given field type. This can give you
interesting insight into your databases. Which fields might overflow
(or underflow if applicable) soon or which fields have very large values
for unintended reasons. Numeric values are checked against the highest
allowed number. Text values against the max length for the field.

Use-case
----------------

On databases that are in-place and being used for extended
periods of time, a lot of data is being accumulated.
This means that at some point, some of the data will outgrow
the designated data types. This tool provides a way of handling
this problem in a proactive/preventive manner.

This tool can offer useful information for integer data types (for
example ID columns, or for data types that grow in size over time)
and for text data types.

The following data or data types are outside the scope of this tool:
- [BIT fields](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/bit-field-literals.html)
- columns storing [UUID values](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_uuid)
- columns that store IP addresses
- columns that store hashes values (MD5, SHA1 for example)

Testing
-------

This tool has been developed and tested using MySQL 5.5.49 and PHP 5.5.9
and is expected to work on PHP >= 5.5.9
